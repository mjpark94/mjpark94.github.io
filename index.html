            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                My Name is Michael, and I am currently learning Web Development through Code Academy's Front End Engineer Program! Welcome to My First Website
                <br> I have always been fascinated with <span>Web Development</span> and finally found the means to sit down and learn!
                <br>I worked as a nurse in the emergency department during the initial wave of Covid, which has given me much insight on the struggles people face during this ongoing pandemic.
                <br> I hope that I can look onto this new career with fresh eyes and progress along my journey to becoming a valuable web developer in the future!
                <br> Cheers!
            </p>
